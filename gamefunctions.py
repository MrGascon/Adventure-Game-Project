""" Project Adventure Functions Module

This module contains several utility functions designed for a text-based adventure game. It handles in-game
transactions, randomly generates monsters, displays welcome messages, and formats shop menus.

Key features include:
purchase_item: Determines the quantity of items a character can purchase with their current funds.
new_random_monster: Generates a random monster with varying attributes like health, power, and monetary rewards.
print_welcome: Prints a welcome message with the player's name centered according to a specified width.
print_shop_menu: Displays a formatted shop menu showing items and their respective prices.
getParity: Checks if a given integer is even or odd.
